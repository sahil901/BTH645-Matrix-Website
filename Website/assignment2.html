<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Welcome to a Mr.Sub Commercial</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Presented to you by Patel Films</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Shot on a Samsung Galaxy S21 and Drone by Sahil Patel and this video is about ordering a sub.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Hmmmm, what are the best fast-food restaurants near me right now? I see A&W, let me see the rest of them right now. A&W, Downie street, pita pit, Erie drive in, Quesada, Subway, Mr.Sub, Villa Shwarma. Wait wait wait, Mr.Sub??? How good is it? Oh 4.5 rating! Let me scroll down and look at the reviews. Oh, its got some nice reviews! Let me see the directions, how far is it? WHAT?! Its only 6 minutes, lets go!</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Yeah lets go, let me grab my keys real quick. Oh my slippers are right here, lets go. Oh its cold, lemme close the door real quick.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">OKAY, I finally arrived. Let me turn off my car and hop out. It’s really cold today. Let me look at the deals. Substantial value, $7.79 for a large. There’s nothing veggie but let me go inside and ask.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Hello, how are you? I’m good, what can I get for you today sir? May I please just get a large veggie sub on Greek bread.</p>
<br>
<b class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The video will be panned to the point of view of an instructor which will show how easy it is when ordering a sub at Mr.Sub.</b>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Now we are going to learn how to prepare a sub.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Here we are going to select the type of bread and cut it without cutting straight through it and bring it over.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">After bringing the sub over, we would select the type of cheese and the necessary toppings such as lettuce and tomato.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Once we have put all the toppings, we would add the necessary sauces.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Once all the sauces have been added, we would close the sub as neatly as possible like this and bring it over to our industrial griller. It is very hot so be careful and press the sub down and set the timer.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Once the sub is done grilling slowly lift up the top. Now use our handly tool is easily lift up our sub and place it on the wax paper. Use our knife to easily cut through the sub and wrap it firmly.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Pick up the bag, place the sub and twist it. Then walk over to the customer and place the sub down.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Its just that easy, thanks for listening.</p>
<br>


<h1 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Further Explanation</h1>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">In regards to my audio recording, I used kapwing to record my voice, remove background noise such as other customers,the equipment in the store , and trim the audio clip to match the video. Additionally, I adjusted the volume of me speaking to ensure it is louder than the background music. I also cut out alot of filler such as stops I made while I was talking which resulted into a more smooth video.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">In terms of the background music I used a free audio sample that is available on youtube for free content use. It matched the uplifting nature of my video as it was about being happy and doing what you want. Therfore, I used this sound. Simple, sweet and effective.</p>
<br>
<p class="c"; style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">When talking about the video selection, i wanted to do a video on something that is important to me. This is a business that my family owns so it was a no brainer for me to do it on this. I've done marketing for my store and it has thorughly helped my family. In my town, there are a lot of fast food places to eat so I started the video off with the poinr of view of the customer and then once the sub was being made I did a narration of the process. I did this because I wanted to reflect how a person thinks before choosing a place to eat and then how easy it is to make the sub and how our customers would benefit from our fast service. Additionally, I was able to get some footage/picutures for any further marketing via this assignment so I'm excited for that. Overall, a fun video/experience.</p>
